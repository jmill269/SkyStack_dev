* How to Run app and Connect to Drone

1. Install the APK for the specific App to your mobile device.(link available inside app folder)
2. Make sure that your mobile device running the app and the system running FlytOS are on the same network.
3. If your network does not have internet or you are connecting to FlytPOD(or other device running FlytOS) in AP mode make sure your mobile device **Data connection is turned off**. This helps for enabling communication over local network.
3. Launch the app providing it appropriate permissions (e.g. access to device location)
4. Enter the URL(IP) of the system running FlytOS in the URL box that shows up and click on connect.
