# Mobile Apps

These are mobile apps built in native languages like Java for Android or using cross-platform frameworks like Cordova. These apps run on a ground device and communicate with the drone using RESTful and WebSocket APIs

**Android-Apps:**
These are native Android apps built using java and Android Studio. This approach provides full flexibility in terms of native support for the platform. 

**HTML-JS-Apps:**
These apps are built using web technologies - HTML/JS/CSS and Cordova framework. Using cordova the app can be converted to desired target platform like Android, iOS or Blackberry etc. This is a good option for quick prototyping and building cross platform apps.

Instructions to install and try out an app are available in the app directory. If you want to customize a sample app or build your own, please visit out [developer documentation](http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/Developers/BuildingCustomApps/RemoteMobile.html#write-remote-mobile) for detailed steps.
