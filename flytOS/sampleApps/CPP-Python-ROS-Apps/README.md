# CPP-Python-ROS Apps (Onboard Apps)

These apps run onboard the companion computer (on the drone) running FlytOS. These are ROS nodes or scripts written in CPP/Python. This is preferred option for real-time processing e.g. obstacle avoidance, object tracking etc.
Onboard apps can in turn interact with remote web/mobile apps using FlytAPIs.
