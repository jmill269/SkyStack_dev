# SkyStack_dev
Localizing drone via GPS/camera feed alone


# Yo!
All you should need to do is type "git clone https://github.com/jmill269/SkyStack_dev.git", and
a new directory should pop up named SkyStack_dev. 'cd' into that directory and then you should
be able to start getting jiggy with it.

# Basic Commands
So, right now the only file in here is this README. Say I want to add a file called 'make_drone_land.py'.
Once that file is in the same repo as this README, you can type "git add make_drone_land.py" to add it to be
staged for committing. And if that's all you want to do for the day, type "git commit -am 'i added this file'",
then "git push". You'll probably be prompted for your git username/password the first time, but afterwards you should just
be able to push without typing that in.
